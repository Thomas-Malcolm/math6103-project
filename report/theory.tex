Neutron cross section

Scattering collision

- In-elastic (changes direction and speed. Assume this doesn't happen for simplicity)
- Elastic (changes direction but not speed)

\subsection{Assumptions and Limitations}

Isotropic point source at the centre of the bomb that emits monoenergetic neutrons, with the bomb being a single 
isotope material with no imperfections. Not so much a spherical cow model as it is a spherical bomb model.

Instead, we make a couple 
concessions. As it isn't so much the volume of the medium that affects the criticality of our system, but the density of 
neutrons within that medium, we can hope to approximate the behaviour for regular systems by scaling down our medium to a point 
of similar density.
