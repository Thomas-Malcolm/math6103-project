\section{Results}

It is difficult to compare our results directly to literature, due to hardware limitations resulting in a maximum number of 
simulated neutrons that is far below what would be required for more natural geometries. Instead, we can make observations 
about the behaviour of the simulation output, and comment on whether it is aligned with what we would expect to occur.
